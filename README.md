Hi, I'm Daniel! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Machine & Deep Learning Engineer specializing in developing and deploying end-to-end ML solutions that address real business needs. I transform complex data challenges into robust, production-grade systems, achieving measurable results such as improved accuracy, reduced operational costs, and enhanced product quality.

Most of my professional work resides in private repositories, but I occasionally share interesting examples, case studies, or insightful snippets here.

I'm always happy to connect, discuss ideas, or explore new opportunities in the ML and AI space. Feel free to reach out!
